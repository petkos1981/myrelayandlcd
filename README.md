Library for 4 channel relay and menulibrary to control them

This projectÂ´s idea is to get easy usable libraries for 4 channel relay and LCD menusystem to operate them


--- With what I develop this project ---
- New version of ubuntu and relativity fast CPU and 8 Gb memery
- Arduino Mega
- 4 Channel relay module
- ethernet shield
- RTC module
- LCD shield with buttons

--- Somekind of vision about this project ------

Step 1 ->
LCD displays
First row:  "  Lights 1"
Second row: "> Lights 2"


Step 2 ->
LCD displays
First row:  "Lights 2 selected" (custom named relays)
Second row: "Toggle On/Off"


---- Distant future ------
- Time and date can be seen from LCD
- Timed relay toggles
- Toggles changed via local network or phone
- Relay names changable from local www-site or phone
